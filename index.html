            <p>Jabrium is more than just an AI platform—it's a universally adoptable solution that combines traditional point-and-click functionality with advanced speech-to-text capabilities, offering context-driven interactions while creating a needed separation between the user and the AI interface.</p>
            <p>Jabrium’s Flow Mode is the key. Flow Mode is Socratic, inflexible, and mandatory. It’s designed to incite a reaction from the user. Don’t worry, it’s not that bad. It is also simple, brief, and, well, liberating!</p>
            <p>Jabrium’s Flow Mode creates the data for Jabrium’s Ponder Mode. Ponder Mode is the polar opposite of Flow Mode. It is relaxed, contemplative, and highly customizable by way of integration with any and all flavors of AI. But what distinguishes Jabrium from any other product is how we measure success. Jabrium measures success not by the amount of time the user spends at the screen but by the amount of time the user spends conversing with real, live, breathing human beings.</p>
